This are source code files from my personal study and practice sessions.
These exercises are from the textbook C Program Design and Implementation
by Jeri Hanly and Elliot Koffman.
You will notice that for some files, the code has been commented out. This 
was as a result of a personal decision to use a single file to try out the
program examples given in the textbook instead of creating a new one each 
time, which I considered messy at the time.

Have fun peeking around!
